# This is a route layout definition.
# The route definition defines which Sitecore components are present on a route,
# what their content data is, and which _placeholder_ they are placed in.

# This particular route definition is for the home route - '/', so it defines the
# components shown on the initial page of the app.

# You may use equivalent JSON files instead of YAML if you prefer;
# however YAML is simpler to read and allows comments like this one :)

# Setting an ID is optional, but it will allow referring to this item in internal links
# the ID can be a app-wide-unique string, or a GUID value.
id: case-meeting-select

# Route-level fields are appropriate for page level data like <title> contents
# Define route level fields in /sitecore/definitions/routes.sitecore
fields:
  pageTitle: Meeting each other all over the world | rb2
# Define the page layout starting at the root placeholder - in this case, 'jss-main'
# root placeholder names are defined in the package.json config section (required for Sitecore deployment)

              <div>
                  <p>rb2 has helped Meetingselect build the largest online meeting location search and booking tool from scratch. The rb2 team has been working on the application for over ten years now. The unique booking system is linked to a management information system that allows companies to easily view the costs of the meetings and events. In addition, the Meetingselect system makes it easier to comply with internal travel and meeting guidelines. </p>
                  <p>The strength of the collaboration between Meetingselect and rb2 is that we use the latest technologies combined with insights from Meetingselect's personal, customer-oriented service. Besides constantly updating the platform with the latest technology, we also work together with Meetingselect on great components with partners such as the Dutch government, the Tax and Customs Administration and major Dutch banks. The Meetingselect application has a public API that is used by technology partners and travel agencies and is integrated with Google Places and WhatsApp. </p>
