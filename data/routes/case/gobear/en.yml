# This is a route layout definition.
# The route definition defines which Sitecore components are present on a route,
# what their content data is, and which _placeholder_ they are placed in.

# This particular route definition is for the home route - '/', so it defines the
# components shown on the initial page of the app.

# You may use equivalent JSON files instead of YAML if you prefer;
# however YAML is simpler to read and allows comments like this one :)

# Setting an ID is optional, but it will allow referring to this item in internal links
# the ID can be a app-wide-unique string, or a GUID value.
id: case-go-bear

# Route-level fields are appropriate for page level data like <title> contents
# Define route level fields in /sitecore/definitions/routes.sitecore
fields:
  pageTitle: Case Detail | rb2
# Define the page layout starting at the root placeholder - in this case, 'jss-main'
# root placeholder names are defined in the package.json config section (required for Sitecore deployment)

        The name 'GoBear' originates from the company's motto, 'go bare or go home'. It's a funny way of explaining that
        GoBear disrupts the financial sector by allowing consumers to compare financial products and insurance in one click.
        Since 2015, GoBear has expanded to six countries in Asia, with its headquarters in Singapore. GoBear will continue
        to expand across Asia in the years to come.
